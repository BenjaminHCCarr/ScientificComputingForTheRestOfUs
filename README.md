# Introduction to Scientific Computing

Good principles in scientific computing can help you write code that is easier
to maintain, easier to reproduce, and easier to debug. But it can be difficult
to find an introduction to get you started. The goal of this project is to
provide reproducible documents you can use to get started on the most important
points.

## A brief overview of the contents

## Getting started

You don't need to install anything! We rely on [JuliaBox.com][jlbox], a
cloud-based service to run reproducible documents in the cloud. We will use the [Julia][jl] language;
but you don't need to know anything about it either. We will keep the discussion veery general, and
not use any of the (very cool!) language-specific features and syntax.

## Contributing

There are a number of ways to contribute. Before you start, please have a look
at our [Code of Conduct][coc]. It boils down to *be nice and respectful* -- no
contribution, no matter how amazing it may be, justifies or excuses bad
behaviour.

[coc]: https://github.com/tpoisot/IntroScientificComputing/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

The first thing you can do is comment on Issues that have the ["Request for
feedback"][feedback] label. They represent situations for which we are actively
seeking community feedback, and anyone is always welcome to chime in.

If there is a more specific point you would like to raise, you can [create a new
Issue][new_issue], and explain your idea, critique, or comment. And of course,
you can always browse the [current Issues][issues], to get a sense of what is
being discussed.

If you want to contribute more, then great! Have a look at the [contribution
guidelines][cguid] first, to get you started with setting up a development
environment. You can always have a look at ["Good first issues"][first], if you
want some inspiration.
