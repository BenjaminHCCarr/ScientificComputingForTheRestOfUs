# Introduction to Scientific Computing

Good principles in scientific computing can help you write code that is easier
to maintain, easier to reproduce, and easier to debug. But it can be difficult
to find an introduction to get you started. The goal of this project is to
provide reproducible documents you can use to get started on the most important
points.

## Getting started

You don't need to install anything! Solving installation issues is discouraging,
and time consuming. Instead, we rely on [JuliaBox.com](https://juliabox.com/), a
cloud-bases service to run reproducible documents in the cloud.

### Setting up a JuliaBox account

### Adding the repository to your JuliaBox account

### Running the notebooks
