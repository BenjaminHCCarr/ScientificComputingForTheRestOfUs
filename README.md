# Introduction to Scientific Computing

Good principles in scientific computing can help you write code that is easier
to maintain, easier to reproduce, and easier to debug. But it can be difficult
to find an introduction to get you started. The goal of this project is to
provide reproducible documents you can use to get started on the most important
points.

## Getting started

You don't need to install anything! We rely on [JuliaBox.com][jlbox], a
cloud-based service to run reproducible documents in the cloud. We will use the [Julia][jl] language;
but you don't need to know anything about it either. We will keep the discussion veery general, and
not use any of the (very cool!) language-specific features and syntax.
