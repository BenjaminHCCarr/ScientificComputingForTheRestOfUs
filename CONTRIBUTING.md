## A note about Jupyter notebooks in GitHub

Because Jupyter notebooks store the output, and the execution order, things can
get messy from a version control point of view. We highly recommend that before
submitting a pull request, you *Clean all output* and *Shutdown the kernel* for
the lessons you are working on. This will put the lessons in "blank slate" mode,
where learners can start.
